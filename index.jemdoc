== About me

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate of [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/ Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences (IEMS)] at McCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern University. I am also a researcher in residence at Center for Science of Science and Innovation and [https://www.nico.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)], where I am fortunate to be advised by [https://www.dashunwang.com/ Prof. Dashun Wang] from [https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/ Kellogg School of Management]. Before joining Northwestern, I got my Bachelor degrees in Statistics ([https://www.math.pku.edu.cn School of Mathematical Sciences]) and Economics ([https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn National School of Development]) from Peking University in 2016.

#My research takes a multidisciplinary approach -- combining my background in mathematics, computer science and economics -- to exploit the opportunities and promises offered by Big Data. Through the lens of new and increasingly available large-scale datasets, I hope to use and develop tools of network science to help improve the way in which we understand the interconnectedness of the social technical and business world around us. My current work focuses on quantitative understanding of successes and failures in individual career from large-scale datasets.
