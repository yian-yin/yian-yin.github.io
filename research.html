<p>My research examines <i>how individual, social, and environmental processes independently and jointly promote (or inhibit) scientific progress and innovation achievements</i>. In my dissertation, I have applied and developed a wide range of computational tools to help us better understand (1) how successful innovations emerge from repeated failures, (2) how scientific careers unfold with social and environmental changes, and (3) how successful ideas in science interact with broader socio-economic institutions. This research agenda is only possible because of the increasing availability of large-scale datasets and the increasingly sophisticated computational tools and capabilities. Together, they offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand the fundamental dynamics and uncertainties underlying the inner-workings of science, innovation, and other socio-economic institutions. By embracing approaches from artificial intelligence and complexity sciences to sociology and economics, results from my research program not only improve our ability to understand and facilitate scientific progress and breakthroughs, but also have implications for entrepreneurship and sustainable technological and business innovation.
</p><p>
As a <i>computational social scientist</i>, I have also used science and innovation as a powerful lens to examine broader processes and outcomes in management and organizations. My research has yielded a range of generalizable insights that are relevant to a variety of complex social processes, from artistic and cultural productions to public policy, from media attention to market competition to human conflict. Next, I will describe three interconnected pillars of my research program, followed by a brief discussion on future directions, outlining my plans to further expand my research program.</p>
<h2>Research topics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>The tipping point between failure and success</b><br />
Current research on science and innovation has mainly focused on data of published papers, granted patents, or released products, implying that existing insights are limited to ideas, individuals, or teams that have succeeded in the first place. Yet, most innovations fail, sometimes in a speculative manner. But our knowledge of why, how, and when failures lead to eventual victory (or defeat) remains limited. In a recent paper published in <i>Nature</i>, I develop a new empirical and theoretical basis to advance our quantitative understanding of failures. By analyzing three large-scale datasets of repeated attempts by NIH investigators, serial entrepreneurs, and terrorist organizations, this paper probes a simple yet fundamental question: how do we go from failure to success?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Production and recognition of successful ideas in individual careers</b><br />
The rapid growth of science and its increasing complexity have created unprecedented opportunities and challenges for understanding and managing the scientific enterprise. Understanding the key mechanisms underlying career lifecycles carries growing importance for identifying and nurturing talents across a diverse range of domains. My research in this direction has focused on understanding both general patterns governing individual careers and important change processes frequently occurring within a career. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Beyond science: A broader definition of impact</b><br />
The bulk of studies on science have focused within the scientific ecosystem. Yet we know relatively little about their impact beyond the ivory tower. Indeed, science has long been described as a social institution that interacts with many other aspects of human society, which affects our ability to confront some of today’s biggest challenges – from the pandemic to climate change, from fake news to privacy and security. Hence there is an urgent need to understand the role and impact of science outside science – in the halls of government, public perceptions, marketplace applications, and more.</p>
